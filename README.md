# Alpha diversity of microbial community at differenet ecosystems 

This repository is aimed to evaluate alpha diversity of microbial community in various metrics across different ecosystems with R packages. 

The repository covers four sub-tasks:

- Compute various alpha diversity metrics based on 16S amplicon microbiome datasets available online using R packages 
- Compare resultant alpha diversity metrics across different ecosystems 
- Correlation between different alpha diversity metrics 
- Modeling alpha diveristy and environmental factors and host genetics (such as, diets, ages, cigarette, ethnics), considering confounders 

Alpha-diversity metrics commonly used in microbiome studies include:

- Shannon
- Inverse Simpson
- Simpson
- Chao
- Faith's Phylogeny Diversity (Faith's PD)
