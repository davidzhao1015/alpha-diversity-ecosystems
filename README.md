# Alpha diversity of microbial communities across earth, human and fermented food ecosystems 

In ecology, alpha diversity refers to richness (number of species) and evenness (frequency of occurrence of each type of species) in an ecosystem. Biodiversity loss and mass extinction of species, in both macro- and micro ecosystems, are two challenges affecting human health and the environements. Therefore, this repository is aimed to evaluate the alpha diversity of the microbial community in various metrics across different ecosystems with R packages and statistical analysis. 

The repository covers four sub-tasks:

- Compute various alpha diversity metrics based on 16S amplicon microbiome datasets available online using R packages 
- Compare resultant alpha diversity metrics across different ecosystems using statitical tests
- Correlation between different alpha diversity metrics 
- What factors shape alpha diveristy of a microbial community? Modeling alpha diveristy and environmental factors and host genetics (such as, diets, ages, cigarette, ethnics), considering confounders 

Alpha-diversity metrics calcualted in this repository are commonly used in microbiome studies include:

- Shannon
- Inverse Simpson
- Simpson
- Chao
- Faith's Phylogeny Diversity (Faith's PD)

16S amplicon sequence data, phylogentic information and metadata are derived from publicaly available database, 

- Human Microbiome Project 
- Global sourdough starter microbiome (Landis EA, Oliverio, and et al, eLife, 2021)
- Earth Microbiome Project (Thompson LR, Sanders JG, and et al. Nature, 2017)
